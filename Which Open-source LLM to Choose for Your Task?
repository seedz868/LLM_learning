Types of Augmentation
1 instruction tuning
2 chat tuning
3 long context models
4 domain/task adaptation

LLM Starter Pack: A Pragmatic Guide to Success with the Large Language Models

bench marks may have been used in training ,be careful

==================================================

​LLMs in Production - A Costly Dilemma!

pillars of success
	is model generalizable
	models should be evaluable
	deployment should be cost optimal
	
Gemeralizatiopn
	knowledge retrieval
	recommender system
	cross lingual translation
	autonomous/ai agents/

Deciding foundational model
	num of parameters
	size of context window
	training type
	inference speed
	cost
	fine tunability
	data security

Model selection
	is open source/proprietry
	num of parameters 
	is training data available
	what is inference speed/latency
	cost of inference of model
	is model fine tunable
	cost of fine tuning
	what is size of context window of model
	fine tuning is 2-4x as expe as inference
	
Costs
	infra
	hidden costs
		
do we promp engineer or fine tune?
	promp eng: for domain dataptation, embedding based search.
	fine tuning: categorization and filtering
	not a guarantee tho
	
Context Windows
	Longer - handle complex longer inputs, less change of hallucinations
	Smaller - require clear concise prompts. easy to write prompts. low latency, faster iteration. 

Costs 
	Upfront - context window, promting/fine tuning/ data, infra, scalability
	Hidden  - model drift/prompt drift, hardware costs, compliance, people, reliability
	
Benchmarking system
	Scalability: scale ot large number of models when not feasible to collect sufficient data for all possible model pairs
	Incrementality: System should be able to evaluate a new model using small number of trials
	Unique order: system provide a unique order for all models

most orgs need domain specific benchmarking
	openAI evals, HELM, evals-harness

ELO base evaluations becomibg popular
	nemo guardrails, aviary, etc

LLMs
	search summarize generate classify rewrite cluster extract
	

	
LangChain
	data aware - link LLM to other data sources - files syss, databases, apis
	agentic - create agents . decide what how todo
	chains - output of 1 llm into another llm. diff tasks, diff inputs
	
	Components
		schema
		models
		prompts
		indexes
		memory
		chains
		agents
	
	Use cases
	personanl assistant
	quest answers over docs
	chatbots
	querying tabular data
	interact with apis
	exteraction
	evaluation
	summarization 
	
Models Module
	LLMs
		takes prompts as input to generatea correspoind completions
		prompts lenght and specificity influence completions focus, broader -> more creative
		
		pre trained openai, cohere, anthropic
		open s model hub - hugface.
		open s llms - stab diff, bloom
