Which Open-source LLM to Choose for Your Task?

ELO ratings.

ranking LLMs' performance

Types of Augmentation
1 instruction tuning
2 chat tuning
3 long context models
4 domain/task adaptation

â€‹LLMs in Production - A Costly Dilemma!

pillars of success
	is model generalizable
	models should be evaluable
	deployment should be cost optimal
	
Gemeralizatiopn
	knowledge retrieval
	recommender system
	cross lingual translation
	autonomous/ai agents/

Deciding foundational model
	num of parameters
	size of context window
	training type
	inference speed
	cost
	fine tunability
	data security

Model selection
	is open source/proprietry
	num of parameters 
	is training data available
	what is inference speed/latency
	cost of inference of model
	is model fine tunable
	cost of fine tuning
	what is size of context window of model
	fine tuning is 2-4x as expe as inference
	
Costs
	infra
	hidden costs
		
do we promp engineer or fine tune?
	promp eng: for domain dataptation, embedding based search.
	fine tuning: categorization and filtering
	not a guarantee tho
	
Context Windows
	Longer - handle complex longer inputs, less change of hallucinations
	Smaller - require clear concise prompts. easy to write prompts. low latency, faster iteration. 

Costs 
	Upfront - context window, promting/fine tuning/ data, infra, scalability
	Hidden  - model drift/prompt drift, hardware costs, compliance, people, reliability
	
Benchmarking system
	Scalability: scale ot large number of models when not feasible to collect sufficient data for all possible model pairs
	Incrementality: System should be able to evaluate a new model using small number of trials
	Unique order: system provide a unique order for all models

most orgs need domain specific benchmarking
	openAI evals, HELM, evals-harness

ELO base evaluations becomibg popular
	nemo guardrails, aviary, etc
